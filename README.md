# AGSPL
AGSPL is my programming language with variables, stack, conditions, functions etc.

# Run
To run an AGSPL program, you need to install python 3, and run the python file called `run.py` with following arguments:
  `-f /home/user/file.gspl` -- For full file path (Use `C:/Users/user/file.gspl` for Windows).

  `-a file.gspl` -- For path in the folder where the python script located. Same with Windows, Linux, and MacOS.
